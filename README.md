# Tiny 3-phase power meter
A very tiny ESP8266 based PCB to monitor your apartments / homes power consumption using CT clamps and report the reading to Home Assistant using ESPHome!

## Credits
As for all my PCBs: Huge thanks to Quindor from QuinLED.info and also the folks from #pcb-design-talk on his Discord server! Would not have been able to do anything without these people!!

## KiCad dependencies
It might happen that KiCad is missing my custom footprints. You can find and download them here and then add them to KiCad: https://github.com/ezcGman/andys-footprints

## Key features
